# über Base
A custom module for Drupal (8.x) to provide some default functionality beyond core that adds some legacy and common features I enjoy having in all my implementations of the popular framework.

## Installation

Just like any custom module for a Drupal installation; Drop the module into your site's/platform's custom module folder. Name this folder "uber_base".

## Features

überBase adds blocks and other configurations to a Drupal site.

### Configurable commonly used blocks

*  Site mission
*  Footer message
